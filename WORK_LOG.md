| April 5 |  9-10pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Nov 14  |  2-3pm   |   I finished my compress method but am going to change my num method into a map for constant time lookups. I am also still working on the expand method and finishing my for loop to read the data every two bits after i get the length. |
| Nov 17  | 3-3:30pm | I removed my num method and turned it into a map for fester lookups. I also edited my compress code to work with this change. I also completed my expand method using a map of chars and a for loop to expand the length of the sequence. |
